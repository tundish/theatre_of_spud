Theatre of Spud
:::::::::::::::

February 14th, 1984.

Somewhere in the English Midlands, a humble local side will for the second time battle the mighty Liverpool
in the cup tie of a lifetime.

And across town on this cold foggy night, Edward Lionheart debuts his youth production of `Arms and the Man`.

Amid technical hitches, one withering critic and a diabolical director, can a young boy called *Spud*
save this theatre from disaster?
