Dog
---

[BRENDA]_

    Hello, I'm Brenda.

[BILL]_

    Hello. Do you have a child in the play?

[BRENDA]_

    Yes my son. Spud.

[BILL]_

    And what's Spud's role?

[BRENDA]_

    He plays the dog.

[BILL]_

    Is there a dog?

[BRENDA]_

    Major Saranoff's dog. I think it comes from the film version.

[BILL]_

    Ah.

Officer
-------

[PLAYER]_

    Spud, I've got a message from Edward. Is there any way you could fill in and play the Officer in Act One please?

[SPUD]_

    So where's Danny?

[PLAYER]_

    Danny's gone to the football.

    Have you got a script?

[SPUD]_

    I don't think I'll need the script. I can remember.

    Can I still be the dog as well?

[PLAYER]_

    Yes of course you can.

    Thank you!

Trousers
--------

[SPUD]_

    Danny's taller than me. These trousers are a bit tight.

[PLAYER]_

    You'll be fine, don't worry.

Got the lead
------------

[PLAYER]_

    Spud, what a mess.

[SPUD]_

    What's up?

[PLAYER]_

    Spud, I've just come from Ed.

    Do you think you might be able to quickly learn the lines for Bluntschli?

[SPUD]_

    What's happened to Michael?

[PLAYER]_

    He's gone with his Dad to the football.

[SPUD]_

    I sort of know most of it anyway.

    But won't I also have to be the Officer?

[PLAYER]_

    Edward thinks it will work if you do a costume change on the balcony.

    He'll come and talk you through it later on.

[SPUD]_

    All right.

Drag
----

[PLAYER]_

    We've just heard; a bit of a shock. Hayley's not coming in tonight.

    So we need someone to play Louka.

[SPUD]_

    Is she at the...

[PLAYER]_

    The football, yes.

    Spud, you can say no if you don't want to do it.

[SPUD]_

    Doesn't she have to kiss Sergius?

[PLAYER]_

    Yes, I think she does.

[SPUD]_

    That's okay.

[PLAYER]_

    Good lad.

Adapting
--------

[PLAYER]_

    OK, so don't forget. In Act Three when you're Bluntschli, Nicola will take Louka's line about the post arriving.

[SPUD]_

    Nicola who plays Catherine?

[PLAYER]_

    No, Adam who plays Nicola.

[SPUD]_

    Got it.

[PLAYER]_

    I think. Err.

    Anyway, one of them will do it.

Threats
=======

Tempest
-------

[LIONHEART]_

    But, as 'tis, we cannot miss him.
    He serves in offices that profit us.

[LIONHEART]_

    What, ho! Slave. Caliban!
    Thou earth, thou. Speak!

[LIONHEART]_

    I pitied thee. Took pains to make thee speak.
    Taught thee each hour one thing or other.

[LIONHEART]_

    These three have robbed me.

    And this demi-devil; for he's a bastard one,
    has plotted with them to take my life.

King Lear
---------

[LIONHEART]_

    Through tattered clothes great vices do appear; Robes and furred gowns hide all.

[PLAYER]_

    You'll be fine, don't worry.
