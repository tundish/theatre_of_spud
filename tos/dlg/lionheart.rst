Tempest
-------

[LIONHEART]_

    But, as 'tis, we cannot miss him.
    He serves in offices that profit us.

[LIONHEART]_

    What, ho! Slave. Caliban!
    Thou earth, thou. Speak!

[LIONHEART]_

    I pitied thee. Took pains to make thee speak.
    Taught thee each hour one thing or other.

[LIONHEART]_

    These three have robbed me.

    And this demi-devil; for he's a bastard one,
    has plotted with them to take my life.
